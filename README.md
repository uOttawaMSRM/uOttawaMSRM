### Branch synchronizatiom
It is important to get the new version of the programs, especially when you want to modify the code in order to avoid merge conflicts.
To retrieve updates:
1. Go to GitHub Desktop, and click on fetch origin.
2. If there are any new commits, it will prompt you to pull from origin. Click on the blue Pull origin button.
3. If there are not any new commits, nothing will pop up.

## Important information
1. Do not save your data in the GitHub repositories, use (whatever Adrian chooses, maybe dropbox?) 
2. For help with things not explained here, see https://docs.github.com/en.
