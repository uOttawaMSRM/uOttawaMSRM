# uOttawa MSRM lab Git
GitHub profile for the ARC 531 microscopy lab.  
To learn about our setup, please read the following instructions.
  
## How to use Git/GitHub
### New collaborators
1. Be added to the uOttawa MSRM lab organization (under uOttawaMSRM - Your Organizations - uOttawa-MSRM-lab - People)
2. Be added to repositories you work on ((Applicable repository) - Settings - Manage access)

### Terminology
See https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary.

### Branch synchronizatiom
It is important to get the new version of the programs, especially when you want to modify the code in order to avoid merge conflicts.
To retrieve updates:
1. Go to GitHub Desktop, and click on fetch origin.
2. If there are any new commits, it will prompt you to pull from origin. Click on the blue Pull origin button.
3. If there are not any new commits, nothing will pop up.

We will use branches to manage changes to the code. **Branches allow you to work on the code without breaking the working code (in the main branch).** When your change is finished, you can then merge it with the main branch.  
How to use branches: https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches.
